# **Start Up Project**
## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever played a **Connect 4 game**? And been embarrassed because you lost to your younger sibling? What I want to do is not only make an online connect four game, but implement a computer to help you make the best move so that you never lose. I also want to make it so you can play against the computer. It can be bragging rights to see who can *survive the longest.*
### Technology
Authentication: I will have someone login in order to access the computer.
Database data: I will keep track of how many moves someone survives against the computer. And keep a record of anyone who can beat the computer. 
WebSocket data: I would like to display a random meme that would be something similar to "Play ball". I will have one picture for the mean time until will get to this part.
